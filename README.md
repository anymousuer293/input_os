# InputOS
An Input Operating System made in python! This is an operating system. You can make your own applications in it but you have to include my username in the credits. AKA anymousuer293.

There is multiple programs I made in this exact operating system. So you can run it by going into the input folder and run input_getpass_os.py

The username and password for the os is admin and input. For example:

Username: admin

Password: input

In all lowercase ok.
