Dear User,

You are using InputOs. This is a low-level operating system. This was inspired by the 1960s and the linux terminal.
This is a program written in Python. You can make copies of this program, but you need to include my name. Or github user anymousuer293.
You can make your own programs actually. Just you have to look at source code.

Sincerely,
anymousuer293
